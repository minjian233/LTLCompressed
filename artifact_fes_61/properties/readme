This directory contains information on how we construct a DFA for the corresponding finite LTL formula.
All the info files are organized in the following way:
  1. Firstly it presents the original finite LTL formula.
  2. Then it presents a infinite LTL formula that preserves satisfiablity with the assumption that all finite traces are now infinite by infinite trailing "t"s.
  3. It then shows the equivalent formula we feed into Rabinizer. A png file containing the deterministic rabin automaton is also provided.
  4. Since all traces are encoded with numerical values(explained in the other readme file) and the experiment was done with projected traces, 
  this file also provides the alphabet that the traces are projected onto and the mapping between events and numbers.
  5. It also provides the formula to run the compressed algorithm with.
  6. The last section of each file presents the DFA obtained from the corresponding deterministic rabin automaton.
