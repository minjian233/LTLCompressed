original property:
!G(create)
property on infinite traces:
!G(create|t)

property feed into rabinizer:
!G(a&!b&!c|t)

Alphabet = {44(create),45(explicit_delete),46(implicit_delete)}
Formula feed into the compressed algorithm:
!G(44)
Finite automaton:
Accepting state = 1
State 0 : {44} -> 0
	  {45,46} -> 1
State 1 : {44,45,46} -> 1
