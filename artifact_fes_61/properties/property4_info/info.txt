Original property: 
G(create -> X(explicit_delete | implicit_delete))
Transformed property:
G(create -> X(explicit_delete | implicit_delete)ï¼‰

Formula feed into rabinizer:
G(((a&!b&!c&!t)->X((b&!a&!c&!t)|(c&!a&!b&!t))))

Alphabet = {44(create),45(explicit_delete),46(implicit_delete)} 

Formula feed into the compressed algorithm:
G(44->(X(45)|X(46)))

Transformed finite automaton:
Accepting states = 0 , 1
State 0 : {45,46} -> 0
          {44} -> 1 
State 1 : {45,46} -> 0
