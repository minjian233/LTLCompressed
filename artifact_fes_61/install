The repo contains two algorithms. The compressed algorithm evaluates linear temporal logic formulas without until on SLP-compressed traces in polynomial time. 
To compile it simply do:
> cd compressedAlgorithm/src/LTL
> javac *java
The uncompressed algorithm contains 13 automatons for each of the property and are designed to be run on uncompressed traces.
To compile it simply do:
> cd compressedAlgorithm/src/LTL
> javac *java
More details about the usage can be found in the readme file.
